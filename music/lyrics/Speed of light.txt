Time has gone with speed of light
Like a current in the circuit
Even the most sensitive sight
Cannot notice it
Love has gone with speed of light
Nobody knows what's love indeed
Maybe something that makes blind
Inculcating phantom needs

Sun gives the warmth
To every lonely soul on Earth
But for the Universe
What it's worth?

Life has gone with speed of light
It's gone out like short burning match
All the fears are left behind
But all the treasures are left untouched

Sun gives the warmth 
To every lonely soul on Earth
But for the Universe
What it's worth?
