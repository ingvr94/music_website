In flow of monotonous days
There's a shimmer of shiny rays
And if you look in depth, you will see
Everything's uncertainty
And if i could just know right way to go
Where would be the point?

Life is game of dice
But dice is in your hand
Everything is tend to depend
And everything definitely comes to end.

You are used to constancy
But life's a thing that nothing guaranties
And direct line goes chaotically
Subdued to uncertainty
Just one flash can give a dash
To change destiny

Life is game of dice
But dice is in your hand
Everything is tend to depend
And everything definitely comes to end.
