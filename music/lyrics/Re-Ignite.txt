Skinny angel in dark clothes
Is it time to go?
Is it time to find out the worth 
Of my soul?
Before the Day of Judgement would you
Open my eyes?
Feed me by the burning truth
To realize 
Why?

Why we try to reignite 
If we burn again?
For what we share our hearts' light
To feel only pain

Is your love bad or blessed 
Does it matter in the end?
We are all equal in the face of death
Is it hard to comprehend?
We try to please our Gods 
Writing praises in verse
We live on land against all odds
Like everything in universe 
Why?

Why we try to reignite 
If we burn again?
For what we share our hearts' light
To feel only pain
