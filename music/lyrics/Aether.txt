I remember this half-light
Of little cozy room 
Smell of short sacred night
And sweet radiance of moon
Every time like last time
I taste her lips 
With sense that I did silly crime
My mind eclipsed

Air is like aether
When I lay with you here

I woke up with blissful face
But smile's just disappeared 
I cursed talks of God's grace
And rage that I feared
You walked in lands of evergreen
I slowly go insane
I wish I could stay with you in dream 
And never back again 

Air is like aether 
When I lay with you here
