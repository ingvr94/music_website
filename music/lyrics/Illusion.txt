Love's illusion of clouded mind
Self-suggestion of lonely man
Discouragement of the pride
Lovers are taken for a ride

Your eyes are opened, but you're blind
Vision's sheltered by pink shroud
Every warning is denied
Love brings to knees every time

Love’s illusion
Discouragement

Love's illusion, perfect tale
Suggesting us through TV screens
Building around us made-up pale
And closing eyes on betrayal

Love's illusion of clouded mind
Self-suggestion of lonely man
Discouragement of the pride
Lovers are taken for a ride

Love’s illusion
Discouragement
