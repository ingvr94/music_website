Where's the sense in world
When whole world's in you?
Your internal gloom
Is so beautiful

Let me be the light
Cause light only shines in dark
I would be a fleeting spark
Get lost in you

Open me your microcosm
And let me in
On outside you are in blossom
But inside you're frozen

Could you feel a thing
Or
did your stars go out?
Under pressure of crowd
You're dying

Open me your microcosm
And let me in
On outside you are in blossom
But inside you're frozen
