Supernova
Shines in the void
Illuminating
Every lifeless asteroid
Supernova
Slowly fades away
Like every life form's
Fated to decay

We'll explode before we go out
We'll explode 

Supernova 
Won't burn again
Giving to new stars
Her flame
Neutron star
Weak and cold
Ends its days
Bright and gold 

We'll explode before we go out
We'll explode 

Nothing can withstand 
The flow of time
Everything has its end
Every life's segment of line
