Spacetime

I am lost
In time and space
In distorted vision
Of this place
What's seems high's
Satan's trump card
It was circle of lie
Right from the start
And I know
In time and space
I'll dissolve
Without a trace
Like in bad dream
With a bitter end
With ray of hope
Of imaginary land

I wanna find the way to the starlight
Which shines in absolute universe
Where it's clear what is wrong and what is right
And life seems a gift not a curse

Good distorts
In time and space
It can't stand a mass of lie
And falls into disgrace
In universal Tartarus
Smoulders tiny blue spark
Seems a little time and it will
Disappear in the dark

I wanna find the way to the starlight
Which shines in absolute universe
Where it's clear what is wrong and what is right
And life seems a gift not a curse
