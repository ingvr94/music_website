I met you 
On the junction of tectonic plates 
What could I do
When heaven opened golden gates?
I made a pace to outer space
Losing sense of gravity 
I flew so high to nacreous sky
From fallen reality 

If the world crashed down 
And all the lords lost their crowns 
I'd revel euphoria 
Of dementia

I met you
On the way to eternal sands 
Elegiac view
Of world went out of our hands
Holy blaze fell from grace
No faith could be justification
Bleeding heart was torn apart
In the name of satisfaction 

If the world crashed down 
And all the lords lost their crowns 
I would revel euphoria 
Of dementia
And if we live the life in vain
With any kind of acute pain 
I could believe it's in the name
Of dementia
