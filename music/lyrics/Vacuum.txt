I flew into this world from somewhere above
Carrying in my soul fragile love
There is no betrayal, pain and fraud
Above the world

I flew into this world like careless dove
And plain room was lightened by childish laugh
But everything is lifelessly cold
Above the world

Vacuum in my heart
Tears the other hearts apart
Every word of me is tart
I am dead inside
Fire was put out by fatal tide

I understood at once power of gravity
Like shackles it robustly holds me
Freedom left in wing-beat of bluebird 
Above the world

Vacuum in my heart
Tears the other hearts apart
Every word of me is tart
I am dead inside
Fire was put out by fatal tide
